SQL ----------

DQL includes:

SELECT

WHERE

ORDER BY

GROUP BY

HAVING

DISTINCT

Aggregate Functions

LIMIT

BETWEEN

IN

LIKE

--------------------------------

🔥 1️⃣ Basic SELECT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;


Example:

SELECT name, email
FROM student;

🔥 2️⃣ Select All Columns
SELECT *
FROM table_name;


Example:

SELECT * FROM student;

🔥 3️⃣ WHERE Clause (Condition)
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


Example:

SELECT * 
FROM student
WHERE student_id = 1;

🔥 4️⃣ Using AND / OR
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;


Example:

SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name = 'Rahul' AND student_id = 2;

🔥 5️⃣ ORDER BY (Sorting)
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;


Example:

SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY name ASC;

🔥 6️⃣ DISTINCT (Remove Duplicates)
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;


Example:

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM student;

🔥 7️⃣ LIMIT (MySQL Specific)
SELECT *
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;


Example:

SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 5;

🔥 8️⃣ Aggregate Functions
COUNT
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name;

SUM
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name;

AVG
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name;

MAX / MIN
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;

SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name;

🔥 9️⃣ GROUP BY
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;


Example:

SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY name;

🔥 🔟 HAVING (Used with GROUP BY)
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

🔥 1️⃣1️⃣ BETWEEN
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

🔥 1️⃣2️⃣ IN
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2);

🔥 1️⃣3️⃣ LIKE (Pattern Matching)
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';


Example:

SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name LIKE 'R%';
------------------------------------------------------

LIMIT

Controls number of rows

OFFSET

Skips rows

Operators

Comparison

Logical

Special (BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL)
--------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ LIMIT

👉 Used to restrict number of rows returned.

✅ Syntax (MySQL / PostgreSQL style)
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;

💡 Example
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 5;


👉 Sirf first 5 rows dikhayega.

🔹 2️⃣ OFFSET

👉 Used to skip certain number of rows.

✅ Syntax
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
LIMIT number OFFSET skip_count;

💡 Example
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;


👉 Pehle 5 rows skip karega
👉 Next 5 rows show karega

Matlab page 2 type scene 😌

🔹 3️⃣ Pagination Formula (Interview Favourite)

For page-based data:

SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT page_size OFFSET (page_number - 1) * page_size;


Example:
Page size = 10
Page number = 3

SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

🔹 4️⃣ MySQL Alternative Syntax

MySQL also allows:

SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT offset, count;


Example:

SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 5, 5;


👉 Skip 5 rows, show next 5 rows.

🔥 Now SQL Operators (Very Important)

Operators are used inside WHERE clause.

🟢 1️⃣ Comparison Operators
Operator	Meaning
=	Equal
!= or <>	Not equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater or equal
<=	Less or equal
Example
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE student_id > 5;

🟢 2️⃣ Logical Operators
Operator	Use
AND	Both conditions true
OR	Any condition true
NOT	Reverse condition
Example
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name = 'Rahul' AND student_id > 2;

🟢 3️⃣ Special Operators
🔹 BETWEEN
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE student_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10;

🔹 IN
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE student_id IN (1, 3, 5);

🔹 LIKE
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name LIKE 'R%';


👉 Starts with R

🔹 IS NULL
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE email IS NULL;
